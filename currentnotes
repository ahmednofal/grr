searching through SendReply and HandleMessage 
functions of the GRRClientWorker
Aftewards we will be revisiting the server 
frontend.py file which contains similar
info that relates to the communication protocol

We can use the Drain method of the GRRClientWorker
through checking if any other class instantiates 
GRRClientWorkers, then we can check if there are 
any queues containing the GRRClientWorkers(s) and
from the instances in the queue we can use the drain
method and retrieve all of the GRRMessages

GRRClientWorker is used in GRRHTTPClient which
is used by the client.py file which is the 
entry point/script for the client after installation
